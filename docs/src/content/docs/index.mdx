import { Card, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

## Install

Add to your Claude Code config in one command:

```bash
claude mcp add tariff -- npx -y @atriumn/tariff
```

Or add the JSON config manually — see the [Getting Started](/getting-started/) guide.

## What can it do?

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Model Lookup" icon="open-book">
    Look up pricing, context windows, and capabilities for any LLM. Fuzzy matching means you don't need exact model IDs.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Cost Estimation" icon="pencil">
    Estimate the cost for a given number of input and output tokens on any model. Know what you'll spend before you spend it.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Model Comparison" icon="list-format">
    Filter and compare models by provider, context window, or mode. Find the most cost-effective model for your workload.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Live Data" icon="cloud-download">
    Pricing data sourced from the LiteLLM community registry, cached for 24 hours with on-demand refresh.
