Implement this issue fully per the requirements.

## Issue #10: Rename package from @atriumn/tariff to tokencost-dev

## Summary
Rename the package to align with our domain (tokencost.dev) and eliminate brand confusion.

## Changes required
- `package.json`: name (`tokencost-dev`), bin command, description
- `CLAUDE.md`: all references to tariff
- `README.md`: install instructions, package name references
- `docs/`: astro config site name, content references
- GitHub repo name: atriumn/tariff → atriumn/tokencost-dev
- CI workflow if it references the package name
- npm: publish under new name, deprecate old `@atriumn/tariff` if published

## Notes
- This should land before any GTM work (publish, directory listings, README improvements) since they all depend on the final name
- CLI command becomes `tokencost-dev` (i.e. `npx tokencost-dev`)
- MCP tool names (`get_model_details`, etc.) stay as-is — they're generic and don't need renaming

Implement all requirements from the above issue(s). Reference: #10


**MANDATORY BEFORE OUTPUTTING LOOP_COMPLETE:**
1. Run tests — all must pass
2. If you created or modified any Supabase migration files:
   a. Run `supabase migration up --local` — apply your migration to the local DB
   b. Run `pnpm generate:types` — regenerate TypeScript types from the DB
   c. If types changed, commit them: `git add apps/web/src/lib/supabase/database.types.ts && git commit -m 'chore: regenerate database types'`
3. Run lint: `pnpm lint` — must pass
4. Run typecheck: `pnpm --filter web exec tsc --noEmit` — must pass
5. Run `git status` — working tree must be clean (all changes committed)
6. Run `git log --oneline -5` — must show commits YOU authored on this branch
7. Run `/home/jeff/projects/alloy/shared/scripts/ralph-review.sh --worktree /home/jeff/projects/worktrees/tariff-10 --issue 10 --project tariff`
   - If it prints PASS — you are clear to output LOOP_COMPLETE
   - If it prints BLOCKING — fix every listed issue, re-commit, then re-run the review
   - If it prints ERROR — ignore and proceed (review service unavailable)

If ANY check fails, keep working. Do NOT output LOOP_COMPLETE until all pass.
Reading files and writing a plan is NOT done. Committed, tested, reviewed code is done.
