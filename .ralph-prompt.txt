## Issue #12: Normalize provider prefixes in fuzzy matching

## Summary
Users often reference models with provider prefixes like `azure/gpt-4o`, `bedrock/anthropic.claude-3`, `vertex_ai/gemini-pro`, `openrouter/anthropic/claude-3`. Our fuzzy matching should strip these prefixes before attempting a match.

## Changes
- **search.ts**: Add prefix stripping logic before fuzzy match
- Handle known prefixes: `azure/`, `bedrock/`, `vertex_ai/`, `vertex_ai_beta/`, `openrouter/`, `together_ai/`, `fireworks_ai/`
- Should work in both `get_model_details` and `calculate_estimate`
- Add tests for prefix-stripped matching

## Context
AgentOps/tokencost handles this via provider prefix normalization. Users copying model names from their API configs shouldn't have to manually strip these.

Implement all requirements from the above issue(s). Reference: #12


**MANDATORY BEFORE OUTPUTTING LOOP_COMPLETE:**
1. Run tests — all must pass
2. If you created or modified any Supabase migration files:
   a. Run `supabase migration up --local` — apply your migration to the local DB
   b. Run `pnpm generate:types` — regenerate TypeScript types from the DB
   c. If types changed, commit them: `git add apps/web/src/lib/supabase/database.types.ts && git commit -m 'chore: regenerate database types'`
3. Run lint: `pnpm lint` — must pass
4. Run typecheck: `pnpm --filter web exec tsc --noEmit` — must pass
5. Run `git status` — working tree must be clean (all changes committed)
6. Run `git log --oneline -5` — must show commits YOU authored on this branch
7. Run `/home/jeff/projects/alloy/shared/scripts/ralph-review.sh --worktree /home/jeff/projects/worktrees/tariff-12 --issue 12 --project tariff`
   - If it prints PASS — you are clear to output LOOP_COMPLETE
   - If it prints BLOCKING — fix every listed issue, re-commit, then re-run the review
   - If it prints ERROR — ignore and proceed (review service unavailable)

If ANY check fails, keep working. Do NOT output LOOP_COMPLETE until all pass.
Reading files and writing a plan is NOT done. Committed, tested, reviewed code is done.
