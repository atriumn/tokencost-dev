Implement this issue fully per the requirements.

## Issue #11: Support cached/prompt caching token pricing

## Summary
LiteLLM data includes a `cache_read_input_token_cost` field for models that support prompt caching (e.g. GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet). We should surface this in our tools.

## Changes
- **pricing.ts**: Read and normalize `cache_read_input_token_cost` from LiteLLM data
- **get_model_details**: Show cached token pricing when available (e.g. "Cached input: $X.XX / 1M tokens")
- **calculate_estimate**: Add optional `cached_tokens` parameter to calculate blended cost with cached vs uncached input tokens
- **compare_models**: Indicate which models support prompt caching

## Context
Prompt caching is increasingly common across providers. AgentOps/tokencost already supports this field. Users making cost decisions should see the caching discount.

Implement all requirements from the above issue(s). Reference: #11


**MANDATORY BEFORE OUTPUTTING LOOP_COMPLETE:**
1. Run tests — all must pass
2. If you created or modified any Supabase migration files:
   a. Run `supabase migration up --local` — apply your migration to the local DB
   b. Run `pnpm generate:types` — regenerate TypeScript types from the DB
   c. If types changed, commit them: `git add apps/web/src/lib/supabase/database.types.ts && git commit -m 'chore: regenerate database types'`
3. Run lint: `pnpm lint` — must pass
4. Run typecheck: `pnpm --filter web exec tsc --noEmit` — must pass
5. Run `git status` — working tree must be clean (all changes committed)
6. Run `git log --oneline -5` — must show commits YOU authored on this branch
7. Run `/home/jeff/projects/alloy/shared/scripts/ralph-review.sh --worktree /home/jeff/projects/worktrees/tariff-11 --issue 11 --project tariff`
   - If it prints PASS — you are clear to output LOOP_COMPLETE
   - If it prints BLOCKING — fix every listed issue, re-commit, then re-run the review
   - If it prints ERROR — ignore and proceed (review service unavailable)

If ANY check fails, keep working. Do NOT output LOOP_COMPLETE until all pass.
Reading files and writing a plan is NOT done. Committed, tested, reviewed code is done.
